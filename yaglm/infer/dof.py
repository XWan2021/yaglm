def est_dof_support(coef, intercept=None, transform=None, zero_tol=1e-6):
    """
    The size of the support of the estimated coefficient (or a transform therof) is sometimes a reasonable estimate for the degrees of freedom e.g. in Lasso, SCAD and some generalized Lasso problems.

    Parameters
    ----------
    coef: array-like
        The estimated coefficient.

    intercept: None, float, array-like
        (Optional) The estimated coefficeint.

    transform: None, callable(coef) -> array-like
        (Optional) The transformation applied to the coefficient e.g. for the generalized Lasso.

    zero_tol: float
        Tolerance for declaring a small value equal to zero. This addresses numerical issues where some solvers may not return exact zeros.

    Output
    ------
    dof: int
        The estimaed number of degrees of freedom. The DoF of the coefficeint is given by either ||coef||_0 or ||transform(coef)||_0
